It presents products visually engagingly to customers by offering attention-drawing swapping effects for images of products on archive/shop pages.

== Description ==

A picture is worth a thousand words. With WPC Product Image Swap, sellers can amplify the power of pictures even more impressively. It presents products in a visually engaging way to customers by offering attention-drawing swapping effects for images of products on archive/shop pages or special product listings.

Image swap helps visitors of your site get a quick preview of products and available options without leaving the current page. With fewer clicks or less navigation back and forth, customers are encouraged to make decisions faster. This can effectively engage visitors and quickly put them into the position of choosing products to buy rather than just a mere stroll on your site.

How smooth it can be is relatively dependent on the image file size and the number of images used in the gallery for your products. Itâ€™s possible to limit the number of images to be swapped so that the animation can perform fast and not affect your site loading speed.
